        <p>
            Major Dhyan Chand (29 August 1905 â€“ 3 December 1979) was an Indian field hockey player, widely regarded as
            one of the greatest field hockey players in history. He was known for his extraordinary ball control and
            goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era
            where India dominated field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field
            hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964.
        </p>
        <p>Known as The Wizard or The Magician of hockey for his superb ball control, Chand played
            internationally from 1926 to 1949, where he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography,
            Goal, and over 1000 goals in his entire domestic and international career.[14] BBC called him the
            "hockey's equivalent of Muhammad Ali". The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest
            civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan in 1956. His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports
            Day in India every year. India's highest sporting honour, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is named after
            him.

        <p>Dhyan Chand remains a legendary figure in Indian and world hockey. His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes. A number of these revolve around the fact that Singh had extraordinary control over dribbling the ball. Chand's birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India. The President gives away sports-related awards such as the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna, Arjuna Award and Dronacharya Award on this day at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, India.[citation needed]</p>
        <p>The 20th National Award, 2012, the Gem of India, awarded by the Union Minister of India, was given to Dhyan Chand. The award was received by Dhyan Chand's son, Ashok Dhyan Chand (a hockey Olympian in his own right), on behalf of his deceased father. The award was given by Journalist Association of India under the flagship of Journalists Federation of India, Sirifort Auditorium, New Delhi, India, on 22 September 2012.</p>
        <p>India's highest award for lifetime achievement in sports is the Dhyan Chand Award which has been awarded annually since 2002 to sporting figures who not only contribute through their performance but also contribute to the sport after their retirement. The National Stadium, Delhi was renamed Dhyan Chand National Stadium in 2002 in his honour.</p>
